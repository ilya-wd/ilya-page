          <h2 id="preface" tabindex="-1">Preface</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve used Web Components (or WCs) for the first time to build this (<a
              href="http://ilya.page/"
              >this</a
            >) website. My use was somewhat rudimentary and primarily concerned with
            repeated elements, like cards and corresponding dialog elements on the main
            page. My main goal for my (pretty simple) website was not to use web
            frameworks and to avoid client-side dependencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I also didn’t want to write every element in HTML nor use JS with string
            interpolation as an alternative to templates. Before I started building my
            website, I had heard about Web Components and decided to try them.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are pretty neat for a beginner – no need to configure any dev tools or
            install anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they are so neat, a reasonable question arises: is it worth doubling down
            on them and perhaps using them exclusively, or at least extensively, in my
            more significant hobby project? To what degree can they replace or augment
            major web frameworks like React? I decided to read up on it.
          </p>
          <h2 id="definitions" tabindex="-1">Definitions</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components"
              >MDN</a
            >
            defines Web Components as:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              …a <strong>suite</strong> of different technologies allowing you to create
              <strong>reusable custom elements</strong> — with their functionality
              <strong>encapsulated away</strong> from the rest of your code — and utilize
              them in your web apps.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            As currently many people’s first touchpoint with the web development is a
            framework like React, one might quickly conjure up a React component (or Vue
            or Svelte – I’m only familiar with React, so I will confine myself with the
            React example).
          </p>
          <p>
            That association is valid, but only to a limited degree. That is, both have
            reusability and composability as one of their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            But a React component, as&nbsp;<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618"
              >Jeremy Keith</a
            >&nbsp;puts it, relies heavily on its props. Not to mention other parts of the
            framework like hooks (optional) or renderers like React DOM or diffing
            (mandatory).
          </p>
          <p>
            Web Components, on the other hand, are native to the web. They are just
            Vanilla JS (<a href="http://vanilla-js.com/"
              >the largest cross-platform JS framework</a
            >&nbsp;😉), HTML, and CSS. They let you define custom HTML components with
            logic from JS and styles from CSS and inject them into your code as simply as
            your ordinary HTML elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            By native, I mean they have been available in all major browsers since 2020 –
            no need to download any packages to develop or use them.

            Web Components are a suite of standards

          <p>
            As you can note from the MDN’s definition, Web Components is a suite of
            four&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">web standards</a>.
          </p>

            and add some CSS styles. The code and the element are below:

          <h2 id="adoption" tabindex="-1">Adoption</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/1689"
              >According to Google</a
            >, 20% of pages loaded in Chrome are using WC in January of 2024: a twofold
            increase in 3 years but only 2.5% increase in 2 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s a decent number for a technology with a troubled history (more on that
            below).
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t mean that those 20% of loaded pages were built with Web Components
            only. For example, they could be used in React or some other framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, many popular services and big tech firms, including YouTube, use Web
            Components. Some of them, like YouTube, have been using them even before Web
            Components came to browsers via libraries like&nbsp;<a

            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Polymer might be defunct. But as far as Web Components’ ecosystem is
            concerned, it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/lit/lit/">alive</a

                Web Components are platform and framework-agnostic. As a set of W3C
                standards, they can be used anywhere on the web, in a framework, or
                without any. You can even embed them in your Markdown files as you&nbsp;<a
                  href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html"
                  >do HTML tags</a
                >. That essentially makes them&nbsp;<strong>interoperable</strong>&nbsp;–
                and there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://webcomponents.dev/">a handy tool</a
                >&nbsp;for that.

              <p>
                WCs are native to the web now. That makes them future-proof, and a website
                built with them will very, very likely still be up and running 20 years
                from now, just like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/"

                They are simple. Which can be a double-edged sword, as discussed in the
                next section.

                The above also means that Web Components don’t have many out-of-the-box

                routing is problematic. As is&nbsp;<a

                Problematic marketing and publicity. Started more than a decade ago, Web
                Components has only begun getting traction in the past few years. Seeing
                the explosive growth of component-based frameworks on the one hand, many
                in the dev community questioned the relevance and timeliness of WCs. Now,
                the tide seems to turn for Web Components, with more and more community
                members praising WCs in the past year for what they are. The discussion
                isn’t one way, though. Here’s&nbsp;<a

                  >an outstanding article</a
                >, both in terms of the sentiment and approach to the topic, asserting
                that Web Components solve problems wrongly and in the wrong way.
                Definitely worth a read.

                acute this problem becomes, however.

              Styling Web Components is the biggest foot gun of the entire Web Component
              system because it involves something called “Piercing the Shadow DOM”. The
              Shadow DOM is a boundary inside the component where no styles bleed in, and
              no styles bleed out… but some styles do pass through!

                The fact they are a (set of) Web Standard(s) makes them change really
                slowly.

            Comparing the two lists above, one might think the cons outweigh the pros.
            It’s not a number competition, however. The simplicity and nativity to the web
            of WCs make them a good choice for many use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, there’s a list of problems. Many of them are the sprouts of discussions
            about the web, as Web Standards are a pretty big thing that reasonably
            involves a lot of people, many of whom want to pitch in. And yes, these
            problems are not quick to solve because they reside in Web Standards, which
            require lots of considerations and thorough planning to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the bright side, there are already established libraries, like&nbsp;<a
              href="https://github.com/lit/lit"
              >Lit</a
            >&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://stenciljs.com/">Stencil</a>, that bring better
            developer and user experiences, and&nbsp;<a href="https://enhance.dev/"
              >many</a
            >&nbsp;<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/">more</a
            >&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/modernweb-dev/rocket">ones</a
            >&nbsp;are being created.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my part, I will probably continue to use them in smaller things and
            will observe how they and the community around them evolve.
